- do we need account preferences?
- do we need to support other account adapter methods, perhaps
  to let user change their password when it doesnt work?
  - what happens when a password fails during synch?
  - do we need to send notification back somehow?

- cant we use a single sync adapter/server and share it with
  all of the account types?  we're told the account type so we
  can mux on that.

- can we make the contact manager display our contacts by default?
  - I think they only merge after we mark them as shown in the mgr

- we shouldnt import from the local contacts by default. 
  we should have a feature that lets us do that on demand.
